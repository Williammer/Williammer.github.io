<h1>Camo - Image Proxy</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>What It Gives You</h2>

This is an SSL image proxy to prevent mixed content warnings on secure pages served from GitHub.

We want to allow people to keep embedding images in comments/issues/READMEs/google charting.

[There's more info on the GitHub blog](There's more info on the GitHub blog).

Using a shared key, proxy URLs are hashed with hmac so we can bust caches/ban/rate limit if needed.

Camo currently runs on node version 0.4.10 at GitHub on Heroku's Cedar stack.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Proxy google charts</li>
  <li>Proxy images under 5 MB</li>
  <li>Follow redirects to a configurable depth</li>
  <li>Proxy remote images with a content-type of image/*</li>
  <li>404s for anything other than a 200, 301, 302 or 304 HTTP response</li>
  <li>Disallows proxying to private IP ranges</li>
</ul>

At GitHub we render markdown and replace all of the src attributes on the img tags with the appropriate URL to hit the proxies. There's example code for creating URLs in the tests.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

Heroku's cedar stack is the easiest way to deploy this.  They provide free SSL for you and your signing keys are all your own.  Checkout the [README](https://github.com/atmos/camo#readme) for more info.
