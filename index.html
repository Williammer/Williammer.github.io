	Hi there, my name is William He or Weinan He in Chinese. I'm currently living in Hong Kong and working at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.accedo.tv/">Accedo</a> as the Software Developer. 
	<br/><br/>
	My current job is to develop cool Web TV applications, which is one type of web application, with the amazing javaScript. I love to explore and learn more about the web technology world and develop some useful applications in my spare time! 
	<br/><br/>
	Apart from web technology, I have great passion for sports and all types of music. My favorite NBA player is Stephen Curry, who has inspired me to learn the Curry pattern of the Functional programming. ; )
