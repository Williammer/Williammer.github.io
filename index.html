    Hi there, my name is William He (Weinan He). I'm currently living in Hong Kong and working at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.accedo.tv/">Accedo</a> as the Product Software Developer.
    <br/>
    <br/> My current job is to develop cool Web TV applications with javaScript. I love to explore web technologies and develop useful applications in my spare time!
    <br/>
    <br/> Apart from web technology, I also have great passion for sports and music.
    <br/>
