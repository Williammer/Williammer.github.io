title: Joining GitHub
excerpt: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---

Today is my first day at [GitHub][github].  I'm not gonna lie, it's a little
intimidating working alongside these amazing people:

* [tom][tom]
* [chris][chris]
* [pj][pj]
* [scott][scott]
* [tekkub][tekkub]
* [melissa][melissa]
* [ryan][ryan]
* [kyle][kyle]
* [zach][zach]
* [rick][rick]

I use GitHub daily.  I love open source and have for about a decade.  I love
the ecosystem that exists around sharing code for both teaching and learning.
I believe GitHub will continue to grow over the next few years and I'm
abso-fucking-lutely delighted to be a part of something I feel so passionate
about.

I'm hoping that they'll keep me around for a while. :)
