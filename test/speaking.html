<h2>Open Source in Education</h2>
<p>
I posted my slides from POSSCON.  The goal of the talk to let students and
educators know that school alone isn't going to prepare you for real world
software development.
</p>
A few people came up to me after the talk and said "I don't know what school
you went to, but I could program when I graduated."  When I asked him if he
knew how to write software when he graduated, he paused and then he smiled.  I
don't think Open Source or Education alone will prepare you, but I really think
they help.  Here are my slides.

<h2>Everything I know about the Business of Open Source I learned from Indie Hip Hop</h2>
<p>In the fall of 2009 I gave a talk that compared building businesses around
things people love.  It shows off a few indepdent hip hop artists and how they
built a name for themselves.  I gave examples of the growth of independent
labels without large scale promotion and liken it to the VC saturated startup
scene.  The idea was to get people to think that building something they
believed in and were proud of was completely atainable if you build your career
around open source technologies.</p>
